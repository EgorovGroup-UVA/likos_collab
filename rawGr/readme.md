This folder contains radial distribution function results using MD. 

Case 1) p = 5.5, x = 0.1

Case 2) p = 5.5, x = 0.95

Case 3) p = 7.5, x = 0.95

To determine the number of bins for the RDF, we use VMD's g(r) extension to gauge a range of bin sizes.  Upon finding an optimal bin size, it can be inputted into the LAMMPs script to generate the raw data.
